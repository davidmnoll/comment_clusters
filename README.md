This is a demo of an idea to summarize large comment threads into smaller ones by using clustering on vector embeddings to group the comments into a smaller number.  Outliers would still stay on their own.  



I would like to at least 2 clustering algorithms: 

- k-means becuase it seems the easiest
- Louvain method because it appears to work well with power law-based data, and I have a feeling that Zipf's law probably applies to vector embeddings (a nice topic for another blog)
